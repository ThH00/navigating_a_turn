This repository contains three codes:
1. `angled_chaplygin_sleigh`: simulating a modified Chaplygin sleigh whose knife-edge makes a constant nonzero angle with the axis of the sleigh
2. `three_wheeled_vehicle`: simulating a three wheeled vehicle modeled as a rigid body with an angled knife edge constraint at the front wheel
3. `constrained_rolling_disk`: simulating a rolling disk that is constrained to make a constant angle with the vertical and to trace a circle

## angled_chaplygin_sleigh
`get_eom` derives the equations of motion of the angled Chaplygin sleigh symbolically
`solve_eom` solves the obtained equations of motion

## three_wheeled_vehicle
